# Pizza Sales Performance Dashboard

The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of pizza sales by calculating key metrics and visualizing insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Revenue**: Total income from all pizza orders.  
- **Average Order Value**: Total revenue ÷ total number of orders.  
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: Total quantity of pizzas sold.  
- **Total Orders**: Total number of orders placed.  
- **Average Pizzas per Order**: Total pizzas sold ÷ total orders.  

##  Dashboard Overview
The Tableau dashboard provides interactive visualizations of the pizza sales data, including:

- **Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold** — Displays order volume by hour.  
- **Weekly Trend for Total Orders** — Shows order trends throughout the year.  
- **Sales by Pizza Category** — Pie chart showing sales distribution across pizza types.  
- **Sales by Pizza Size** — Pie chart comparing contribution by pizza sizes.
